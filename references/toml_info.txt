Why is pyproject.toml Necessary?

    Standardization: It provides a standardized way to specify build system requirements and project metadata.

    Tool Configuration: It centralizes the configuration for various tools (like black, isort, etc.) in one file.

    Build System: It defines the build system backend, which is crucial for building and packaging the project.

How to Use pyproject.toml

    Build System: When you run build tools (e.g., flit, poetry), they will read the build system requirements from pyproject.toml.

    Tool Configuration: Tools like black and isort will use the configuration specified in the [tool.black] and [tool.ruff.lint.isort] sections.
