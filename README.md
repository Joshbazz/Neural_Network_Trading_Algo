# Neural Network Trading Algo

[![CCDS Project Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/CCDS-Project%20template-328F97?logo=cookiecutter)](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/)

This project implements a neural network strategy for trading based on the research paper titled 'A Stock Market Trading System using Deep Neural Network' by Bang Xiang Yong, Mohd Rozaini Abdul Rahim, and Ahmad Shahidan Abdullah. You can access the paper [here](https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/ee20ae76-656a-47ba-bf5b-fba10ee87478/content).

## Project Structure

The Python implementation resides in the `neural_network_trading_algo` directory. To run the project:
1. Navigate to the `main.py` file in your terminal.
2. Execute the file to perform:
   - Data gathering
   - Preprocessing
   - Model training
   - Model saving
   - Model evaluation
   - Signal generation
   - Backtesting the strategy on generated signals

## Run the Code in Google Colab

If you prefer running the code without downloading the repository or if you're a non-technical user, you can run the project directly in Google Colab. Click the badge below to open the notebook in your browser:
